I showcased full-stack proficiency in developing the Kanji Learner web app, integrating Node.js, Express, and MySQL for a robust backend. Leveraging NHK News and Wanikani APIs enhanced the user experience, providing real-time data for a richer learning journey.

The frontend, designed with Bootstrap, reflects my attention to UI aesthetics and responsiveness. Secure user authentication, employing practices like password hashing, underscores my commitment to privacy.

Dynamic features, including kanji tracking and level progression, highlight my expertise in asynchronous operations with JavaScript. The Kanji Learner project exemplifies my ability to deliver secure, user-friendly web applications, blending functionality and design seamlessly.
