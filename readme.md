I showcased full-stack proficiency in developing the Kanji Learner web app, integrating Node.js, Express, and MySQL for a robust backend. Leveraging NHK News and Wanikani APIs enhanced the user experience, providing real-time data for a richer learning journey.

The frontend, designed with Bootstrap, reflects my attention to UI aesthetics and responsiveness. Secure user authentication, employing practices like password hashing, underscores my commitment to privacy.

Dynamic features, including kanji tracking and level progression, highlight my expertise in asynchronous operations with JavaScript. The Kanji Learner project exemplifies my ability to deliver secure, user-friendly web applications, blending functionality and design seamlessly.

<h2>NOW A FUNCTIONAL DYNAMIC WEBSITE HOSTED ON AZURE</h2>
https://kanjilearner.azurewebsites.net/
*******************************************

Hosted on Microsoft Azure:
Uses Two Webapps that communicate with each other
One Webapp Runs on Express while the other runs on flask
Flask web app communicates with Azure Sql Database
Environment packes are installed in package.json for ExpressApp and requirements.txt for flask app

Limitations from hosting on microsoft Azure:
Selenium module is not supported on azure and most cloud Paas Services therefore that functionaility has been removed
Having an Iaas environent or running selenium on a virtual machine would be a possible solution.
