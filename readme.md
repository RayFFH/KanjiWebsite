# Python Kanji Learning website using REST API

## A functional Kanji Learning website written in Python, javascript and html to allow users create an account, test their kanji knowledge and have the kanji they recognise stored in a database and presented to them

This project was built through inspiration from modern learning websites such as wanikani and anki. I will highlight the main functionalities of this website:

*Create an account and log in to the webserver
*Random Kanji is displayed everytime user enters the website
*User can click recognise or don't recognise button when a random kanji pops up
*The user's previous recognised kanji will be displayed and updated in real time
*User will gain levels by recognising more kanji
*Real time temperature of Tokyo is also displayed
